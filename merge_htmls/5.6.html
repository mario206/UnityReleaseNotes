<h3>Changes</h3>

<ul>
<li>GI: Added support for LOD baking in Progressive Lightmapper. Light Probes are not necessary anymore when baking LODs using Progressive Lightmapper.</li>

<h2>5.6.0f1 Release Notes (Delta since b11)</h2>

<h3>System Requirement Changes</h3>

<ul>
<li>Android minimum version supported updated to 4.1 (JellyBean)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Known Issues</h3>

<ul>
<li>Scripts are pointing to the Editor version of the DLLs instead of Runtime, resulting in "Null reference" errors. (888020)</li>
<li>Animation: Problems with Animator in 5.6.0 beta after upgrading project from 5.5.0p3 (864062)</li>
<li>Editor: Error messages spamming the console during playmode. (879941)</li>
<li>Particles: Game crashes occur during Play mode when a Particle System is a sub-emitter of more than one other Particle System. (857065)</li>
<li>Particles: Sorting Fudge does not work. (884637)</li>
<li>Physics: CCD is broken on pooled objects. (889118)</li>
<li>Physics: RigidBody.collisionDetectionMode cannot be set during runtime if it is initially set to one of the continuous options. (784529)</li>
<li>Scripting: Unity crashes at . (888302)</li>
<li>Video: [Android] Video fails to play (and may crash) on some device/OS version combinations, and especially on Android versions lower than 6.0. (862078)</li>
<li>VR: There is an issue with the current 1.1 Google VR NDK integrated in 5.6 betas when used with the Google SDK for Unity. The Google SDK includes a backwards compatible library for non-integrated scenarios that conflicts with the library integrated into Unity. At this time, if you need functionality provided in the Google SDK (especially audio, which is intgrated with the library that conflicts) then you will need to use the non-native Cardboard functionality provided by the Google SDK. To do this, make sure you do not enable VR for iOS (or if you did, remove the Cardboard device and disable VR). We are working on this issue and will have more details at a later date.</li>
<li>VR: <code>VRSettings.renderViewportScale</code> has unintended graphical effects when rendering sections of the screen at values less than 1. (851282)</li>
<li>VR: There is a discrepancy between the Android 1.2 Google VR NDK update and the iOS 1.1 VR NDK currently integrated in Unity that will cause linking errors. For now, if you need iOS Cardboard support please disable native iOS integration and use the support provided in the Google VR SDK for Unity. This issue will not exist in 5.6.0f2. (885513)</li>
</ul>

<h4>To be fixed post 5.6.0</h4>

<ul>
<li>Android: When MuteOtherAudioSources option is disabled and there's no READ_PHONE_STATE permission, the Unity application running on Android 5.1 or older devices might not mute itself during an incoming phone call. This might cause rejections when submitting to Samsung app store.</li>
<li>GI: [PVR] 32-bit Unity 5.6 crashes if the Scene is baked with Light Probes and PVR texture compression. (888806)</li>
<li>GI: [PVR] G-Buffer job fails when Keep Quads option is enabled (890651)</li>
<li>Services: Collab cannot update to the latest revision if the current revision has been archived and there is a conflict. (857465)</li>
<li>UI: Adding UI elements via script causes OnDisable and OnEnable to be called on all scripts in the hierarchy if a RectTransform needs to be added. Workaround is to add a RectTransform component in the new GameObject call, for example: <code>new GameObject("Canvas", typeof(RectTransform));</code>. (882791)</li>
<li>VR: [Daydream] There is no native controller integration yet. For controller use, please use the Unity SDK provided by Google.</li>
<li>VR: [Daydream] You may notice that your Daydream VR display is dimmer than other VR devices. This is by design, as a means of prolonging battery life while in VR.</li>
<li>VR: <code>UNITY_HAS_GOOGLEVR</code> is enabled for iOS, but the Google SDK for Unity might not check for it correctly and try to use compatibility mode for iOS. This will be fixed with an SDK update from Google.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Improvements</h3>

<ul>
<li>GI: Added a pragma <code>option(nolppv)</code> for surface shaders to strip Light Probe Proxy Volume code when it isn't needed.</li>
<li>VR: Updated Oculus GearVR to version 1.11.1 to fix the GearVR focus timeout issue.</li>
</ul>

<li>Editor: Exposed the following custom handle classes in UnityEditor.IMGUI.Controls: BoxBoundsHandle, CapsuleBoundsHandle, SphereBoundsHandle.</li>
<li><p>Editor: Interactive handles for editing primitive Collider types in the Scene view now all use the same logic:</p>

<ul>
<li>Drag a handle to expand the size only on that side.</li>
<li>Hold  to pin the center in place.</li>
<li>Hold  to scale the shape uniformly.</li>
</ul>

<p>These changes apply to BoxCollider, CapsuleCollider, SphereCollider, BoxCollider2D, CapsuleCollider2D, and CircleCollider2D.</p></li>
<li><p>Editor: Mac: Added experimental support for using the Metal rendering backend on the Editor. This is disabled by default; to enable it, go to Edit &gt; Project Settings &gt; Player &gt; Other Settings and tick the <strong>Metal Editor Support</strong> checkbox.</p></li>

<ul>
<li>Added ability to bake shadowmasks.</li>
<li>New Lighting window layout.</li>
<li>Added Light Explorer window.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>GI: Added new experimental feature: Progressive Lightmapper. This is a robust lightmapper based on path tracing, with progressive updates. It provides baked lightmaps and Light Probes, presents the first output quickly, and iteratively improves it over time.

<ul>
<li>Global illumination is calculated at lightmap resolution.</li>
<li>No dependency on Enlighten.</li>
<li>Normal requirements regarding lightmapping UVs: non-overlapping UVs with small area and angle errors, and sensible padding between the charts.</li>
<li>Texels visible in the Scene view are calculated first.</li>
<li>Estimated time is provided in the progress bar.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>GI: Progressive Lightmapper features: directional lightmaps, transparent materials, better sampling of area lights.</li>
<li>Graphics: Added EncodeToEXR to Texture2D.</li>
<li>Graphics: Added HDR MSAA anti-aliasing support. HDR rendering and MSAA anti-aliasing now works as expected with forward shading.</li>
<li>Graphics: Added physically-based rendering Material validator. You can now validate Albedo and Specular values against acceptable ranges. Albedo values can also be validated against user-defined luminance ranges.</li>
<li>Graphics: Support for DrawMeshInstancedIndirect, where draw arguments are supplied from a ComputeBuffer.</li>
<li>Graphics: Support for Procedural Instancing, where instance data is supplied via a custom source in the Shader, rather than from Material Property Blocks.</li>
<li>Graphics: Vulkan rendering backend added for Android, Linux and Windows. It is not used by default yet; drag it to the top of Graphics API list in Player Settings (menu: Edit &gt; Project Settings &gt; Player) to use it.</li>
<li>IL2CPP: Added support for Windows Runtime when targeting Windows Store and Xbox One players with .NET 4.6 API Compatibility Level. See the Unity User Manual documentation on <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/560/Documentation/Manual/IL2CPP.html">IL2CPP</a> for more information on Windows Runtime support.</li>
<li>IL2CPP: Unity in-app purchase now works on Windows Store with IL2CPP scripting backend.</li>
<li>Multiplayer: Added client websocket support for macOS, Linux and Windows.</li>
<li>Multiplayer: Added support for flexible ack buffer configuration (32, 64, 96 and 128 messages).</li>
<li>Multiplayer: Added thread pool support for macOS, Linux and Windows.</li>
<li>Multiplayer: Added websocket SSL support for macOS, Linux and Windows.</li>
<li>Particles: Added new Shape Module controls to support non-randomized particle emission.</li>
<li>Particles: Redesigned Burst Emission to support 8 bursts, and added burst repeat parameters.</li>
<li>Physics: Added new CompositeCollider2D component, providing the ability to merge together BoxCollider2D &amp; PolygonCollider2D colliders.</li>
<li>Physics: Added <code>Physics2D.Distance</code>, <code>Collider2D.Distance</code> and <code>Rigidbody2D.Distance</code> returning new <code>ColliderDistance2D</code>.</li>
<li>Physics: Added <code>Physics2D.OverlapCollider</code>, <code>Collider2D.OverlapCollider</code> and <code>Rigidbody2D.OverlapCollider</code>.</li>
<li>Physics: Added <code>Rigidbody2D.attachedColliderCount</code> and <code>Rigidbody2D.GetAttachedColliders()</code>.</li>
<li>Physics: Enabled BoxCollider2D &amp; EdgeCollider2D Edge Radius feature.</li>
<li>Physics: Physics Debug

<ul>
<li>A tool designed to provide a visualization of what is going on in our physics middleware (PhysX), allowing you to quickly inspect the Collider geometry in your Scene, and profile common physics-based scenarios.

<ul>
<li>Also serves as a profiling tool, because it can hide all sleeping Rigidbody components and show all concave Mesh Colliders.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Player: Added native Daydream integration as a VR target for Unity VR applications.</li>
<li>Services: Added native crash support for iOS in Unity Performance Reporting service.</li>
<li>UI: Added new <code>AdditionalShaderProperties</code> to the Canvas. This changes the default behavior for all new Canvas components that are created. The old default was to include Position, Color, UV0, UV1, Normal and Tangents whereas the new default is to only include Position, Color, and UV0 shader channels. This reduces the memory cost of rendering the canvas as additional unused channels are not included. If you need the other channels they are selectable per canvas and its recommend to use a minimal set of channels. This also adds the ability to use UV2 and UV3 shader channels if required.</li>
<li>Video: Added Video Player component and Video Clip Importer Asset Importer. They replace Movie Texture and its Importer (available with a legacy control). Note that for use on Android, Android version 6.0 or higher is recommended.</li>

<li>VR: Added initial Vulkan support for OpenVR.</li>
<li>VR: Native Cardboard support for iOS using Metal is now available.</li>
<li>VR: Native Cardboard support for iOS using OpenGL is now available.</li>
<li>WebGL: WebAssembly Support (experimental).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Changes</h3>

<ul>
<li>Android: Buildpipe: Removed the AnyCPU option from .so files in Plugin Inspector.</li>
<li>Android: Incremented the minimum supported Android API from 9 (Gingerbread) to 16 (Jellybean).</li>
<li>Animation: Exposed <code>Animator.playableGraph</code> property.</li>
<li>Editor: Building in linear color space is no longer allowed for platforms that don't support it.</li>
<li><p>Graphics: Refactored camera render ordering code. When a Scene is rendered, it now figures out which cameras can share the same render target. The rules for this are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Cameras must use the same display to share the same render target.</li>
<li>Cameras must share the same viewport.</li>
<li>All cameras must have a depth buffer, or none of them must have a depth buffer.</li>
<li>If the Scene is being viewed in VR, the cameras implicitly share the same render target.</li>
</ul>

<p>These cameras are then split into a stack, which is rendered into a shared Texture based on depth ordering. This Texture has the most common settings found in the cameras in the stack. The following rules also apply:</p>

<ul>
<li>If any camera wants MSAA, the Texture is an MSAA buffer.</li>
<li>If any camera wants HDR, the Texture is an HDR buffer.</li>
<li>If there are any deferred cameras in the stack, MSAA is disabled (MSAA is not compatible with deferred cameras).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Graphics: Removed MSAA from back buffer on most platforms. On iOS and Android, MSAA BB is still allowed. This is because these platforms have a large number of games with no Image Effects, and allowing MSAA BB helps to avoid extra blit. MSAA now requires a Render Texture. This is implicitly supported via the render stack mechanism. If you need MSAA, the target that is rendered to has MSAA enabled (as long as deferred rendering is not used in the stack).</p></li>
<li><p>Linux / SteamOS: Switched window management and input handling from X11 to SDL2 on Linux / SteamOS.</p></li>
<li><p>Scripting: Changed namespace <code>UnityEngine.Runtime.Networking.PlayerConnection</code> to <code>UnityEngine.Networking.PlayerConnection</code> for clarity and consistency with Unity convention</p></li>
<li>Scripting: Script serialization errors that were introduced in Unity 5.4 but did not always throw a managed exception, now always throw a managed exception in Unity 5.6.</li>
<li>Scripting: The behaviour for <code>ISerializationCallbackReceiver.OnBeforeSerialize</code> and <code>ISerializationCallbackReceiver.OnAfterDeserialize</code> has changed when using <code>Instantiate</code> and <code>UnityEditor.PrefabUtility.CreatePrefab</code>. Now <code>ISerializationCallbackReceiver.OnBeforeSerialize</code> is called once on the original object and and <code>ISerializationCallbackReceiver.OnAfterDeserialize</code> is called once on the cloned object after all internal references have been updated.</li>
<li>Shaders: Removed <code>glstate_matrix_mvp</code>, <code>glstate_matrix_modelview0</code>, <code>glstate_matrix_transpose_modelview0</code> and <code>glstate_matrix_invtrans_modelview0</code>:

<ul>
<li>In order to use these matrices, use <code>UNITY_MATRIX_MVP</code>, <code>UNITY_MATRIX_MV</code>, <code>UNITY_MATRIX_T_MV</code> and <code>UNITY_MATRIX_IT_MV</code> instead.</li>
<li>For better performance, always use <code>UnityObjectToClipPos</code> and <code>UnityObjectToViewPos</code> if you are transforming vertices into clip space and view space, respectively. Unity prints a warning message if it detects you using <code>UNITY_MATRIX_MVP</code> and <code>UNITY_MATRIX_MV</code>.</li>
<li>Now that the transforming path has been unified, #pragma force_concat_matrices is obsolete.</li>
<li>Tests show an improvement in CPU performance and a degradation in GPU performance. The difference, however, is only noticeable when vertex load is very high.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Shaders: Shader compilation now stops on the first error.</li>
<li>Windows: Windows 10 SDK is now the default SDK when building to Windows Store.</li>
<li>Windows: Windows Store: Windows 8.1 and Windows Phone 8.1 will be dropped after Unity 5.6. Unity 5.6 is therefore the last Unity release supporting these SDKs.</li>
<li>Windows Store: D3D is now the default build type when building for Universal 10 SDK.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Improvements</h3>

<ul>
<li>2D: Axis Distance Sort: Added <code>CustomAxis</code> to <code>TransparencySortMode</code> of the Camera, to allow you to sort renderers against a preferred axis instead of just by depth from the Camera.</li>
<li>2D: The internal storage of Sprite data has been refactored to a more flexible storage structure. This is the precursor to upcoming 2D features. Textures will be re-imported when you open an existing project in Unity 5.6 for the first time.</li>
<li>Android: Added support for managed stack traces on Android with IL2CPP.</li>
<li>Android: Moved Android splash image to a Java implementation so that it is displayed quicker during engine loading.</li>
<li>Animation: Added a third spine bone called <strong>UpperChest</strong> to the humanoid rig.</li>
<li>Animation: Added performance improvements for selection and keyframe manipulation in Curve Editor.</li>
<li>Animation: Added tracking of Animator State Machine view positions.</li>
<li>Animation: Clarified the warning issued when playing generic clips that animate humanoid bound transforms.</li>
<li>Animation: Disabled auto-framing of AnimatorController when selecting states or transitions.</li>
<li>Animation: Improved the entry transition notice message in the Inspector.</li>
<li>Asset Import: Significant performance improvements to DXT1, DXT5, BC4 and BC5 Texture compressors, resulting in faster Asset imports. Fixed cross-platform determinism of DXT1, DXT5, BC4 and BC5 compressed Textures. You now get the same compressed Texture regardless of the platform it's compressed on.</li>
<li>Audio: <code>AudioClip</code> is now always loaded on a separate thread, resulting in improvements to Scene loading time. This is because the rest of the Scene can be loaded while Audio Clips are decompressed. <code>AudioClip.loadInBackground</code> is now obsolete and no longer used.</li>
<li>Compute: Added ability to set up &amp; dispatch compute shaders from <code>CommandBuffers</code>. See new <code>CommandBuffer</code> functions: <code>SetCompute*Param</code>, <code>DispatchCompute</code>, <code>CopyCounterValue</code>.</li>
<li>Compute: The ComputeShader Inspector now lists kernels, and compiled code shows disassembly on DirectX 11. The <code>UNITY_VERSION</code> macro is passed while compiling compute shaders, just like for regular shaders.</li>
<li>DX12: Reduced system and video memory usage.</li>
<li>Editor: Added interface support to <code>Selection.GetFiltered</code>.</li>
<li>Editor: Graphics device arguments now persist when you relaunch the Unity Editor.</li>
<li>Editor: Improved the performance of the Hierarchy view in the Profiler Window.</li>
<li>Editor: The Unity Editor's Game view window fully supports touch input on Windows when touch screen is available (for example, on a Surface Pro). Functions like <code>Input.GetTouch</code> should therefore start working.</li>
<li>Editor: Window layouts are now serialized as text.</li>
<li>GI: Added a pragma <code>option(nolppv)</code> for surface shaders to strip Light Probe Proxy Volume code when it isn't needed.</li>
<li>GI: Added rgb9e5 float Texture format for precomputed realtime GI on all supported platforms. This format can be interpolated without artifacts. Unsupported platforms fall back to RGBM encoding, and can still have banding from interpolation.</li>
<li>GI: Added to ReflectionProbe: defaultTexture, defaultTextureHDRDecodeValues, textureHDRDecodeValues.</li>
<li>GI: The Enlighten solve type is now set to match the current lightmaps mode instead of always solving directional lightmaps. This is an optimization for Realtime GI with non-directional mode.</li>
<li>GI: Updated default shadow near plane offset.</li>
<li>GI: Upgraded Enlighten SDK to version 3.07p1. This should provide precompute time reductions, which is especially noticeable in the <code>CalculateSystemDependencies</code> step, as well as other steps which perform raytracing. Additional details:

<ul>
<li>An issue has been fixed in baking when using Final Gather, which would result in wrong lighting when using transparent materials.</li>
<li>An issue has been fixed in baking when using Final Gather, which would result in it ignoring the <strong>Backface behaviour type</strong> Material property.</li>
<li>Fixed issue that prevented baked light masks working in conjunction with transparency Textures.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug resulting in wrong lighting for SSD objects when using probes with non-default axes or SH coefficient orders.</li>
<li>When baking direct probe lighting, the per-light option to disable direct lighting is no longer ignored.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>GI: <code>usesRevertedZBuffer</code> is now exposed to <code>SystemInfo</code>.</li>
<li>Graphics: Added cube array Texture support to OSX Metal.</li>
<li>Graphics: Added new API: <code>SystemInfo.graphicsUVStartsAtTop</code>.</li>
<li>Graphics: Added <code>CommandBuffer</code> functions: <code>SetViewport</code>, <code>SetViewMatrix</code>, <code>SetProjectionMatrix</code>, <code>SetViewProjectionMatrices</code>.</li>
<li>Graphics: Added <code>RenderQueue.GeometryLast</code> enum value.</li>
<li>Graphics: Frame Debugger improvements:

<ul>
<li>You can now Ctrl+Click on Texture Properties to display a larger preview (just like the Standard shader UI). This is also useful for viewing Cubemap Textures.</li>
<li>ComputeShader dispatches now shows the compute shader, kernel and dispatch size used.</li>
<li>The Shader properties tab is now the default (instead of Mesh preview).</li>
<li>The Shader properties window now shows the <code>ComputeBuffer</code> properties that are used.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Graphics: Frame Debugger now gives you a reason when a draw call can't be batched with the previous one.</li>
<li>Graphics: GPU Instancing: a new workflow has been implemented. An <strong>Enable Instancing</strong> checkbox has been added to most of the Materials, including those using Standard Shaders.

<ul>
<li>A "#pragma multi_compile_instancing" line is no longer needed in Surface Shaders. Instancing variants are automatically generated for Surface Shaders, unless you explicitly specify <code>noinstancing</code> in a <code>#pragma surface</code> line.</li>
<li>Standard and StandardSpecular also have "#pragma multi_compile_instancing" built-in.</li>
<li>A new checkbox <strong>Enable Instancing</strong> has been added to the Material Inspector. This must be checked for objects rendered with this Material to be instanced.</li>
<li>SpeedTree Assets now print an error prompting you to regenerate the Materials when you enable the <strong>Enable Instancing</strong> checkbox.</li>
<li>When building to players, instancing variants of a Shader are stripped away if no Material using this Shader enables instancing. A new property, <strong>Global stripping control</strong> has been added to Graphics Settings. Note that all existing projects that use instancing need to enable the <strong>Enable Instancing</strong> checkbox if the Material is intended to be used for instancing, including those for <code>DrawMeshInstanced</code>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Graphics: HDR rendering supports R11G11B10 float formats in addition to FP16. This can be configured in Graphics Settings (Edit &gt; Project Settings &gt; Graphics) per platform and per tier.</li>
<li>Graphics: The <code>-gpu</code> command line argument is now supported in the Windows Store player</li>
<li>Graphics: <code>CommandBuffer</code> API improvements:

<ul>
<li>More <code>CommandBuffer</code> APIs: <code>CopyTexture</code>, <code>EnableShaderKeyword</code>, <code>DisableShaderKeyword</code>.</li>
<li><code>CommandBuffer.GetTemporaryRT</code> got an <code>enableRandomWrite</code> argument.</li>
</ul></li>

<li>Particles: Improved overlap solver for particle collision against 2D Colliders.</li>
<li>Particles: The UI for Custom Vertex Streams has been redesigned to allow greater flexibility over what data to send to the shader, and to add more control over how it is packed into the TEXCOORD channels.</li>
<li>Particles: You can now configure Custom Data via the Inspector using a new Module, instead of exclusively via script.</li>
<li>Physics: 2D contacts are now shown in the Inspector 'Info' rollout for Collider2D and Rigidbody2D.</li>
<li>Physics: Added a non-allocating way to retrieve contacts per Collider2D or Rigidbody2D using <code>Physics2D.GetContacts ()</code>, <code>Collider2D.GetContacts ()</code> and <code>Rigidbody2D.GetContacts ()</code>.</li>
<li>Physics: Added non-allocating overloads that use the new ContactFilter2D for Linecast, Raycast, BoxCast, CircleCast, CapsuleCast, OverlapPoint, OverlapCircle, OverlapBox, OverlapArea, OverlapCapsule, GetContacts &amp; IsTouching.</li>
<li>Physics: New ContactFilter2D, allowing physics queries to filter by layer mask, Z depth, normal angle and trigger inclusion.</li>
<li>Physics: The internal 2D contact processing has been completely re-written, providing a more robust and reliable reporting of contacts.</li>
<li>Physics: When using a CompositeCollider2D with Outline generation attached to a Dynamic Rigidbody2D, information about physics properties appears in the Inspector.</li>
<li>Profiling: Added <code>Profiling.Recorder</code> API, which allows you to get the accumulated frame time for the specific Profiler label in the Editor and Development Players.</li>
<li>Shaders: Added the ability to disable Shader pass per-material. See <code>Material.SetShaderPassEnabled</code>.</li>
<li>Shaders: Added <code>HLSLPROGRAM</code> shader snippet support. This is the same as CGPROGRAM, with one difference: HLSLSupport.cginc and UnityShaderVariables.cginc includes are not added automatically.</li>
<li>Shaders: Optimized in-Editor experience for Shaders with potentially massive variant counts (in the order of millions). Importing and first-time compiling them is much faster now.</li>
<li>Shaders: Preprocessor macros <code>SHADER_STAGE_VERTEX</code>, <code>SHADER_STAGE_FRAGMENT</code>, <code>SHADER_STAGE_DOMAIN</code>, <code>SHADER_STAGE_HULL</code>, <code>SHADER_STAGE_GEOMETRY</code>, and <code>SHADER_STAGE_COMPUTE</code> are now defined when compiling each shader stage.</li>
<li>Shaders: The .hlsl file extension is now recognized in the same way as .cginc. it is included in generated IDE projects, and opened same way from the Unity Editor.</li>
<li>Terrain: A warning box is shown if you try to assign a Texture that is not imported as a normal map to the __Normal ma__p slot of the Terrain Material.</li>
<li>Terrain: Terrain Inspector now remembers the last selected brush shape.</li>
<li>Terrain: Terrain LOD pre-computation is optimized and now runs faster. Specifically, <code>TerrainData.SetHeights</code> and setting the Size property are faster now.</li>
<li>VR: Attached VR/AR devices now add their remote resolution to the Game view size's drop-down in the Editor.</li>
<li>VR: Updated Oculus GearVR to version 1.11.1 to fix the GearVR focus timeout issue.</li>
<li>Web: In <code>UnityWebRequest</code>, response code and headers are now available to scripts as soon as they are downloaded. Previously, they were only accesible after the whole download was complete.</li>
<li>Windows: The Unity installer now offers to install Visual Studio Community 2017 (instead of Visual Studio Community 2015).</li>
<li>Windows Store: C++ source code plugins can now be included directly from the generated Visual Studio solution. This is possible by adding the directory containing the source code to the list of include directories, and linking the DLL they get compiled in to the final game executable on the il2cpp scripting backend.</li>
<li>Windows Store: Significantly reduced the size of Windows Store support installers.</li>
<li>Windows Store: The amount of time the postprocessing player step takes when building project on the IL2CPP scripting backend has been significantly reduced.</li>
<li>Windows Store: Unity now uses a pre-built <code>MapFileParser</code> when building generated C++ code on the IL2CPP scripting backend, rather than building it on your machine on the fly.</li>
</ul>

<li>Build Pipeline: Added <code>SetApplicationIdentifier</code> and <code>GetApplicationIdentifier</code> methods to PlayerSettings (Edit &gt; Project Settings &gt; Player). These allow you to set the Bundle Identifier (Apple platforms) / Package ID (Android and Tizen) separately for each platform.</li>
<li>Build Pipeline: Changed <code>Application.bundleIdentifier</code> to <code>Application.identifier</code> and <code>PlayerSettings.bundleIdentifier</code> to <code>PlayerSettings.applicationIdentifier</code>.
