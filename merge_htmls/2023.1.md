*   HDRP: Fixed quad overdraw debug at high resolution. (UUM-33220)
    
*   HDRP: Fixed TAA aliasing edge issues on alpha output for recorder / green screen. This fix does the following:  
    
    *   Removes history rejection when the current alpha value is 0. Instead it does blend with the history color when alpha value is 0 on the current plane.  
        
    *   The reasoning for blending again with the history when alpha is 0 is because we want the color to blend a bit with opacity, which is the main reason for the alpha values. sort of like a precomputed color  
        
    *   As a safety, we set the color to black if alpha is 0. This results in better image quality when alpha is enabled. ([UUM-33950](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/anti-aliasing-around-objects-results-in-outlines-when-recording-against-a-background))

*   IL2CPP: Fixed Marshal.OffsetOf returning the wrong offsets for explicit layouts. ([UUM-35032](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/the-inputsystem-reports-incorrect-inputs-on-macos-with-il2cpp-player-builds-when-using-xboxonegamepadmacoswireless-controller))
