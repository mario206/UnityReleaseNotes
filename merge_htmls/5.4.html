                  <h2>5.4.0f1 (Release Candidate 1) Release Notes (FULL)</h2>

<h3>Features</h3>

<ul>
<li>Asset Import: Importing is now supported for models with more than 100,000 objects.</li>
<li>DX12: Added support for multi-display rendering.</li>
<li>Editor: Optional "strict mode" when building projects and AssetBundles, which will fail the build if any errors (even non-fatal ones) are reported during the build process.</li>
<li>GI: Light Probe Proxy Volumes<br>
This component allows using more than one light probe sample for large dynamic objects (think large particle systems or important characters). This will sample probes into a 3D texture and use that in the shader.

<ul>
<li>Requires shader model 4 (DX11+/PS4/XB1/GLCore).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>GI: Occlusion of the strongest mixed mode light is now stored per light probe.</li>
<li>Graphics: Added ImageEffectAllowedInSceneView attribute for Image Effects. This will copy the Image Effect from the main camera onto the Scene View camera. This can be enabled / disabled in the Scene View Effects menu.</li>
<li>Graphics: Added motion vector support:

<ul>
<li>Requires RG16 texture support.</li>
<li>Motion vectors track the screen space position of an object from one frame to the next, and can be used for post process effects.</li>
<li>See the API docs for Renderer.motionVectors, Camera.depthTextureMode, SkinnedMeshRenderer.skinnedMotionVectors, PassType.MotionVectors, and DepthTextureMode.MotionVector.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Graphics: Basic GPU Instancing Support

<ul>
<li>Use GPU instancing to draw a large amount of identical geometries with very few draw calls.</li>
<li>Works with MeshRenderers that use the same material and the same mesh.</li>
<li>Only needs a few changes to your shader to enable it for instancing. Supports both custom vertex/fragment shader and surface shader.</li>
<li>Set per-instance shader properties from script via MaterialPropertyBlock.</li>
<li>Supports Graphics.DrawMesh command.</li>
<li>Supports DX11/DX12 with SM 4.0 and up on Windows, OpenGL 4.1 and up on Windows/OSX/Linux, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Graphics: Fast texture copies via Graphics.CopyTexture.</li>
<li>Graphics: Graphics jobs can now be enabled (see Player Settings) for a potential performance boost. Currently in experimental status due to unknown project-dependent side effects.</li>
<li>Graphics: Texture Array support; seeTexture2DArray class.</li>
<li>IAP: Added support for fetching IAP products incrementally in batches.

<ul>
<li>FetchAdditionalProducts method added to IStoreController.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>IAP: Cloud catalog support:A 'useCloudCatalog' boolean has been added to UnityEngine.Purchasing.ConfigurationBuilder. When set, Unity IAP will fetch your catalog of products for sale from the Unity cloud. Catalog is configured via the Unity Analytics dashboard.</li>
<li>IL2CPP: Android support for IL2CPP is now official (previously 'experimental').</li>
<li>iOS: Added support for ODR initial install tags.</li>
<li>iOS: Option for custom URL schemes added to Player Settings.</li>
<li>Kernel: The transform component has been rewritten using SIMD and a cache-friendly data layout, so the code is now simpler and faster. As a result, Transform.Setparent for large hierarchies can also be more expensive, since all data for one hierarchy will always be tightly packed together.</li>
<li>OSX: Added Editor-enabled retina support (text and some icons only).</li>
<li>Particles: New Trigger Module, including:

<ul>
<li>A script callback when particles touch a predefined list of collision shapes.</li>
<li>Ability to modify/kill particles that are intersecting the collision shapes.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Particles: Particle width, height and depth (for Mesh particles) can now be defined independently from each other.</li>
<li>Physics: New functions implemented: Physics.OverlapCapsule &amp; Physics.OverlapCapsuleNonAlloc.</li>
<li>Physics: Overlap recovery, used to de-penetrate CharacterControllers from static objects when an overlap is detected. When activated, the CharacterController module will automatically try to resolve the penetration, and move the CharacterController to a safe place where it does not overlap other objects anymore.</li>
<li>Physics: Running the PhysX simulation step can now be skipped if not required by Rigidbodies or WheelColliders.</li>
<li>Physics: The ContactPoint.separation has been exposed.</li>
<li>Shaders: Uniform array support:

<ul>
<li>Uniform arrays can be set by new array APIs on MaterialPropertyBlock, Shader and Material.</li>
<li>The size of an array is lifted to 1023.</li>
<li>The old way of setting array elements by using number-suffixed names is deprecated.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Substance: ProceduralMaterials are now supported at runtime on Windows Store/Phone platforms.</li>
<li>VR: Added support for Native Spatializer Plugins for VR. Oculus Spatializer included with the support.</li>
<li>VR: Native OpenVR support added:

<ul>
<li>Note that native OpenVR support renders with an off-center asymmetric projection matrix. This means that any shaders which relied on fov / aspect may not work correctly.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>VR: Oculus Support for DirectX 12.</li>
<li>VR: Optimized Single-Pass Stereo Rendering available in Player Settings.</li>
<li>VR: VR Focus and ShouldQuit Support: -Application Focus is now controlled by respective VR SDK when Virtual Reality Support is enabled. -Application will quit if the respective VR SDK tells the app to quit when Virtual Reality Support is enabled</li>
<li>VR: VR multi-device support:

<ul>
<li>PlayerSettings: When the Virtual Reality Supported checkbox is checked, a prioritized list is shown allowing devs to choose which VR SDKs their game supports. (Similar to the Graphics API selection dialog)</li>
<li>VR SDK list is per build-target.</li>
<li>Dependencies (such as DLLs) will be copied to the build for every SDK in the list.</li>
<li>At startup, Unity will go down the list and try to initialize each device. If any fail to initialize (for example, if the headset is not connected), Unity will move on to the next. If all fail, Unity won’t enter VR mode.</li>
<li>PlayerSettings: Deprecated PlayerSettings stereoscopic 3D checkbox. This goes through the same subsystem as the VR devices, so a non-headmounted stereoscopic driver is one of the possible devices on supporting platforms.</li>
<li>VR API: Deprecated VRDeviceType enum and VRSettings.loadedDevice. This is replaced with VRSettings.loadedDeviceName and VRSettings.LoadDeviceByName().</li>
<li>VR API: Added the ability to get a list of supported SDKs. Readonly: string[] VRSettings.supportedDevices.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Web: GamePerf service integration. You can now track your exceptions from the wild by enabling this in the Services window.</li>
<li>Web: WebPlayer support has been removed, and the default player is now the platform desktop being run on for the Editor. Therefore desktop platform installation choices are no longer available for their respective editors.</li>
<li>Windows: Added speech recognition APIs under UnityEngine.Windows.Speech. These APIs are supported on all Windows platforms as long as they're running on Windows 10: Windows Editor, Windows Standalone and Windows Store.</li>
<li>Windows: Added support for G-Sync and FreeSync on Windows 10 on DirectX 11 (for the Windows Store player only) and DirectX 12 (for both the standalone player and the Windows Store player).</li>
<li>Windows: Windows Standalone player now can be run in Low Integrity Mode.</li>
<li>Windows Store: Command line argument -dontConnectAcceleratorEvent can now be added to disable accelerator event-based input. This disables support for some keys in Unity (like F10, Shift), but fixes issue with duplicate characters in some XAML controls.</li>
<li>Windows Store: Realtime global illumination now works when using Windows 10 SDK.</li>
<li>Windows Store: UnityWebRequest now supported for all SDKs.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Backwards Compatibility Breaking Changes</h3>

<ul>
<li>Android: WebCam no longer works on Gingerbread devices.</li>
<li>Deployment Management: Any errors logged during the build process will now cause the build to fail. This includes errors that previously allowed the build to succeed anyway, such as shader compilation failures.</li>
<li>DX12: Introduced new native plugin interface IUnityGraphicsD3D12v2 . The old interface will not function anymore due to differences in internal graphics job submission.</li>
<li>Editor: Deprecated UnityEditor.ShaderUtil.ShaderPropertyTexDim; users should now use Texture.dimension.</li>
<li>GI: Deprecated Light.actuallyLightmapped; users should now use Light.isBaked and Light.bakedIndex instead. Baked Light now has unique index, instead of the flag "actuallyLightmapped"</li>
<li>Graphics: Deprecated Material(String) constructor further. This will now always create a material with the error shader and print an error, in both Editor and player. It will be completely removed in a future Unity version.</li>
<li>IMGUI: InvalidOperationException is no longer thrown on opening "select audio clip" pop up dialog. Added EditorGUI.DisabledScope to replace deprecated EditorGUI.[Begin/End]DisabledGroup().</li>
<li>Physics: Made changes to avoid Physics transform drift by not sending redundant Transform updates.</li>
<li>Physics: Physics Meshes are now rejected if they contain invalid (non-finite) vertices.</li>
<li>Playables: Refactored API so that Playables are structs instead of classes, making the API allocation-less in C#.</li>
<li>Scripting: Added two new script errors in the editor for catching calls to the Unity API during serialization. See "Scripting Serialization" page in the manual for more details.</li>
<li>Scripting: UnityEngine.Object.GetInstanceID() is no longer thread safe (change made to facilitate a memory optimization).</li>
<li>Shaders: Changed default shader compilation target to "#pragma target 2.5" (SM3.0 on DX9, DX11 9.3 feature level on WinPhone). Can still target DX9 SM2.0 and DX11 9.1 feature level with "#pragma target 2.0". The majority of built-in shaders target now 2.5. Notable exceptions are Unlit, VertexLit and fixed function shaders.</li>
<li>Web: Promoted WebRequest interface from UnityEngine.Experimental.Networking to UnityEngine.Networking. Unity 5.2 and 5.3 projects that use UnityWebRequest will need to be updated.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Changes</h3>

<ul>
<li>Android: Assets - Disabled texture streaming for Android.</li>
<li>Android: Deprecated UnityPlayerNativeActivity and UnityPlayerProxyActivity; these will now print warnings to the logcat if in use.</li>
<li>Android: Removed native activity implementation. An activity with the same name based on a regular activity is still in place for backwards compatibility reasons.</li>
<li>Audio: Streamed audio clips are no longer preloaded. This is done to reduce the number of open file handles in scenes referencing a large number of streamed clips. The behaviour is not affected except for a slight increase in playback latency.</li>
<li>Audio: Updated FMOD to 4.44.56.</li>
<li>Desktop players: With Webplayer removal, desktop players are now part of their respective Editor installations, so the option to separately install them is removed.</li>
<li>DX12: Disabled client/worker mode as a preparation step for pure threading (-force-gfx-mt now does nothing for DX12).</li>
<li>DX12: Enabled GPU profiler in single-threaded mode (-force-gfx-direct).</li>
<li>Editor: Editor will now trigger a warning when opening a project from any version not matching the project's matching last version string saved in information. This includes small version changes such as 5.4.0b1 to 5.4.0b2, or 5.4.0f3 to 5.4.0p1.</li>
<li>Graphics: Default Camera's background clear color now has 0 alpha, instead of 5/255 alpha.</li>
<li>Graphics: Unity splash screen replacement now uniform across platforms, featuring a light and pro-only dark style.</li>
<li>Particles: Added particle radius parameter for world collisions.</li>
<li>Physics: API changes:

<ul>
<li>Renamed Cloth.useContinuousCollision to Cloth.enableContinuousCollision, and Cloth.solverFrequency to Cloth.clothSolverFrequency.</li>
<li>Exposed Cloth.enableTethers.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Physics: Fixed Character Controller Physics causing capsule to be thrown in the air when exiting another collider.</li>
<li>Physics: Renamed Physics.solverIterationCount to Physics.defaultSolverIterations, and Rigidbody.solverIterationCount to Rigidbody.solverIterations.</li>
<li>Samsung TV: Added Ignore BG Alpha Clear checkbox to Resolution section of Samsung TV player settings. This will disable the clearing of the alpha value for the background fill, allowing for blending between Unity's render layer and the layer behind.</li>
<li>Scripting: Renamed onSceneLoaded to sceneLoaded, onSceneUnloaded to sceneUnloaded, and onActiveSceneChanged to activeSceneChanged, to be compliant with naming conventions.</li>
<li>Scripting: Using GameObject.AddComponent is no longer allowed and will throw an exception. Derive a class from MonoBehaviour and add it instead.</li>
<li>Shaders: Moved internal shader for computing screenspace cascaded shadows into Graphics Settings. If you were overriding it before by just dropping it into the project, you now need the custom one via Graphics Settings.</li>
<li>Shaders: Removed support for EXT_shadow_samplers on non-iOS OpenGL ES 2.0 platform.</li>
<li>Terrain: Terrain objects created in the Scene will now be properly renamed (in the same way as GameObjects) to avoid using the same name.</li>
<li>Terrain: When different TerrainData are used for Terrain and TerrainCollider components on the same GameObject, a warning message will be shown with a button to fix the situation.</li>
<li>UI: Switched component menu name for RectMask2D to match class name.</li>
<li>WebGL: Removed .htaccess file generation.</li>
<li>Windows Store: Deprecated PlayerSettings.WSA.enableLowLatencyPresentationAPI. It is now always enabled.</li>
</ul>

<li>Animation: Improved Animation event performance for repeat calls to the same events on components.</li>
<li>Audio: Added ability to transition AudioMixer snapshots by scaled and unscaled time.</li>
<li>Audio: Added virtualization of audio effects. For audio sources that are virtual because they have been culled due to low audibility or priority, attached effect components or spatializers are now also bypassed in order to save CPU use. The new behaviour is on by default, but can be turned off in the audio project settings.</li>
<li>Audio: Audio clip waveform preview now displays the actual format used for compression when the default format isn’t available on a certain platform.</li>
<li>Audio: Fixed audio clip waveform preview rendering sync issues after import, and improved the way the waveforms are being rendered to be more dynamic and reveal more detail.</li>
<li>Audio: Moved Preload Audio Data to the platform-specific settings section. The previous location was confusing as it was shown grayed-out in the inspector with a checkmark that depended on all overrides.</li>
<li>Audio: SystemInfo now includes supportsAudio info.</li>
<li>Cache Server: Improved the cache server so that it can properly handle scenarios when assets with missing references are being read.</li>

<li>Scripting: Improved Instantiate() performance.</li>
<li>Scripting: Improved SendMessage performance for repeat calls to the same message on components.</li>
<li>Scripting: ScriptUpdater now asks whether to automatically update once per project session (i.e if a different project is opened or Unity is restarted).</li>
<li>Serialization: Serialization depth limit warning now prints the serialization hierarchy that triggered the warning.</li>
<li>Shaders: #pragma targets 3.5, 4.5, 4.6 are accepted.

<ul>
<li>3.5 - minimum version for texture arrays (DX11 SM4.0+, GL3+, GLES3+, Metal)</li>
<li>4.5 - minimum version for compute shaders (DX11 SM5.0+, GL4.3+, GLES3.1+)</li>
<li>4.6 - minimum version for tessellation (DX11 SM5.0+, GL4.1+, GLES3.1AEP+)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Shaders: Added ability to exclude shaders from automatic upgrade by having "UNITY_SHADER_NO_UPGRADE" anywhere in shader source file.</li>
<li>Shaders: Added PassFlags=OnlyDirectional pass tag. When used in ForwardBase pass, it makes sure that only ambient, light probe and main directional light information is passed. Non-important lights are not being passed as vertex light constants, nor are put into SH data.</li>
<li>Shaders: Added shader #pragma to allow easy/cheap variants of shaders across different tiers of hardware in the same renderer without needing keywords (e.g. iPhone 4 and iPhone 6, within OpenGL ES).</li>
<li>Shaders: Added UNITY_SAMPLE_TEX3D_LOD macro, for consistency with other LOD sampling macros.</li>
<li>Shaders: ComputeBuffer data layout now matches between DX and automatically-translated GL shaders. Action required: All OpenGL-specific data layout manipulation in user scripts that get or set data from a ComputeBuffer should be removed.</li>
<li>Shaders: Engine and built-in shaders use five fewer shader keywords now, leaving more keywords for users. The following keywords are thus removed: SOFTPARTICLES_OFF, HDR_LIGHT_PREPASS_OFF, HDR_LIGHT_PREPASS_ON, SHADOWS_OFF, DIRLIGHTMAP_OFF.</li>
<li>Shaders: Extended Standard Shader UI and added new options to disable specular highlights and reflections, and to pack Smoothness into the alpha channel of the Albedo texture.</li>

<li>Shaders: Improved game data build times with many complex shaders, especially when they were already compiled before.</li>
<li>Shaders: Improved shader translation performance when compiling shaders into OpenGL ES 2.0 &amp; Metal.</li>
<li>StackTrace: Deprecated Application.stackTraceLogType; users should now use Application.SetStackTraceLogType/GetStackTraceLogType instead.</li>
<li>StackTrace: For StacktraceLogtype.None only the message will now be printed (without file name or line number).</li>
<li>StackTrace: Stacktrace log type can now be set in PlayerSettings for various log types.</li>
<li>Standalones: Added -hideWindow command line option to launch standalone applications with window hidden.</li>
<li>Substance: Added a FreezeAndReleaseSourceData() method to the ProceduralMaterial class. This renders the ProceduralMaterial immutable and releases some of the underlying data to decrease the memory footprint. To release even more of the underlying data, it is necessary to call Resources.UnloadUnusedAssets() afterwards. Once frozen, the ProceduralMaterial cannot be cloned, its ProceduralTextures cannot be rebuilt, and its inputs cannot be set.</li>
<li>Substance: User now recieves a warning when an input of a BakeAndDiscard ProceduralMaterial is being set at runtime.</li>
<li>UI: Added new property AscentCalculationMode to TrueTypeFont importer to control how font ascent value is determined.</li>
<li>UI: Added rootCanvas property to Canvas.</li>

<li>UI: Created an empty RectMask2D editor and modified the selectable one to hide script fields.</li>
<li>UI: Improved the way that line spacing affects leading in text generation, to provide more predictable leading when line spacing is less than 1.</li>
<li>UI: Made more functions virtual inside Graphics class.</li>
<li>UI: UI now sets the texelSize for use in custom shaders.</li>
<li>VisualStudio: COM no longer used to launch VisualStudio, resulting in better immediate feedback experience.</li>
<li>VR: Added support for the Oculus Rift Remote. It now presents itself to the input system as a joystick named "Oculus Remote".</li>
<li>VR: Audio will now dynamically switch to headset's audio output / input driver (Oculus SDK 1.0+).</li>
<li>VR: Invisible pixels are now masked so GPU time is not wasted (Oculus SDK 1.0+).</li>
<li>VR: The Oculus OVRPlugin signature check now happens only for non-development, release builds.</li>
<li>VR: Updated to Oculus Runtime version 1.5.</li>
<li>VR: Updated to the 1.4 Oculus API.</li>
<li>WebGL: Incremental builds of generated C++ code are now supported.</li>
<li>Windows Standalone: Added "Copy PDB files" option in the Build Settings window. This way, you can control whether or not to copy debugging files.</li>
<li>Windows Store: Added Bluetooth capability to Player Settings.</li>
<li>Windows Store: Added PlayerSettings.WSA.Declarations API for setting declarations for Package.appxmanifest.</li>
<li>Windows Store: Added UnityEngine.Ping class.</li>
<li>Windows Store: Fixed generated Visual Studio solution and Assembly-CSharp* projects so that they will no longer rebuild needlessly. See upgrade guide for more information.</li>
<li>Windows Store: Improved deserialization performance when using .NET scripting backend</li>
<li>Windows Store: Improved Visual Studio project generation. The solution shouldn't rebuild needlessly anymore; however, users may need to delete the old generated project so it can be regenerated.</li>
<li>Windows Store: In Player Settings, visual asset images are now edited using object fields.</li>
<li>Windows Store: New implementation for TouchScreenKeyboard on UWP now supports both XAML and D3D apps as well as IME input. Older implementation can be turned on by passing command line argument -forceTextBoxBasedKeyboard.</li>
<li>Windows Store: PDBs will now be included in the installers for "Release" players as well as debug and master players.</li>
<li>Windows Store: System.operatingSystem will add '64bit' postfix if target device has 64bit CPU (see more information in Unity Documentation).</li>
