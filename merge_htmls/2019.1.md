#### Improvements

*   2D: Added GridPaintSortingAttribute to allow users to specify the sorting of GameObjects listed in the Active Tilemaps list of the Tile Palette
    
*   Android: Add keystores dedicated location option
    
*   Android: Added 'Symlink Sources' in Build Settings window, this enabled Java and Kotlin files to be directly referenced from Unity project in the exported gradle project.
    
*   Android: Adjust the number of worker threads dynamically according to the number of online cores.
    
*   Android: After building the apk, the Proguard mapping file is placed at the same location
    
*   Android: Check Vulkan device compatibility on Build & Run
    
*   Android: Disable various Adreno Vulkan driver workarounds for latest drivers
    
*   Android: Enumerate all Android audio input device options, including the lowest-latency option, which can be selected via the name "Android voice recognition input".
    
*   Android: Improved il2cpp player startup by ~200ms for second and later launches
    
*   Android: Native Systrace profiling support is implemented
    
*   Android: The Unity video player can now be used with the Vulkan renderer.
    
*   Android: Use OpenSL instead of AudioTrack on more devices. This reduces audio input and output latency.
    
*   Animation: Added Experimental methods to AnimationPlay.
    
*   Animation: Added property Avatar.humanDescription.
    
*   Animation: Aligned all Animator StateMachine nodes on the grid
    
*   Animation: Changed default StateMachine node width so that all nodes align vertically.
    
*   Animation: Implemented shift-click and right-click context menu to add properties in animation window without closing popup window.
    
*   Animation: Improved performance for AvatarBuilder
    
*   Animation: Improved support for animationjobs with TransformStreamHandle bound to transform added dynamicaly at runtime.
    
*   Animation: Upgraded the animation window preview/playback engine to use the Playable API.
    
*   Asset Import: Added Support for cameras in Sketchup Importer.
    
*   Asset Import: Extended Optimize Mesh option on Model asset import settings to allow optimization of Vertex Order and Polygon Order to be controlled independently rather than both being controlled from the same flag. NOTE: Performance improvements to the underlying mesh optimization code may cause vertices to be generated in a different order than in previous Unity versions. If you rely on vertex ordering in the optimized mesh data such as for vertex painting be aware this data may need to be re-generated.
    
*   Asset Import: Improved performance of DXT1/BC1 and DXT5/BC3 texture compression. Note that although compression quality is not affected subtly different compressed results will likely be produced
    
*   Asset Pipeline: Scriptable objects that are loaded before a refresh/import, will after a refresh/import be reloaded, if the underlying asset had been modified before the refresh/import. This means that after the refresh/import scriptables objects will have the modified values from modified assets. Before this change, the scriptable object would get "null" value (when using operator==) after the refresh/import.
    
*   Compute: \* Allows more of the scripting CommandBuffers utility functions to be used with command buffers executed on async compute, such as getting temporary render targets.
    
    *   Adds the concept of execution flags to CommandBuffers describing how they are intended to be executed and allowing for better error handling as those command buffers are built in script. This allows for generating exceptions when adding commands not valid for async compute.
    *   Added in editor detection for potential GPU deadlock case where a user creates a GPU fence in one command buffer but then never executes that command buffer.
*   Editor: Added Clear on Build option in Console
    
*   Editor: Added confirmation prompt when deleting a Shortcut Profile through the Shortcut Manager
    
*   Editor: Added field of view axis selection dropdown in camera inspector
    
*   Editor: Adds a keyboard shortcut for the submit button on the changeset submission window and for some commonly used VCS operations (1069130)
    
*   Editor: Assembly Definition File inspector: Assembly Definition References, Assembly References and Define Constraints lists are now reorderable when editing a single Assembly Definition File.
    
*   Editor: Columns in the Shortcut Manager shortcuts list are now resizable
    
*   Editor: Improve performance when interacting with Model Inspector with some large meshes
    
*   Editor: Improved detecting of Visual Studio for Mac detecting when "Visual Studio.app" filename contains suffixes.
    
*   Editor: Improved performance of the model importer inspector material remapping section.
    
*   Editor: Improved the performance of the UIElements renderer
    
*   Editor: Metal: Add texture type validation to built-in Metal API validation feature
    
*   Editor: Moved Camera Easing options to Camera Settings in SceneView from Preferences
    
*   Editor: Reworked Android keystore and key creation UI
