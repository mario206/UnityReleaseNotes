<p>Revision: 44735ea161b3</p>

<h2><a href="https://oc.unity3d.com/index.php/s/bYXgDkAD8Pqzd5z/download">Upgrade Guide</a></h2>

<h3>Known Issues</h3>

<ul>
<li>Connect: 'Go to Dashboard' link for Multiplayer lead to Cloud Build</li>
<li>Editor: Crash when using injecting proxies (e.g. Lavasoft's webcompanion, Astrill, Qustodio)</li>
<li>Home: Stay on connecting window if you don't have internet</li>
</ul>

<h3>Feature</h3>

<ul>
<li>2D: Ability to rotate sprites while Sprite Packing to save atlas space.</li>
<li>Android: Audio - Enable OpenSL for devices that support FEATURE_AUDIO_LOW_LATENCY</li>
<li>Android: ETC1 Compression for Sprite Atlases. The texture is split into two parts without alpha (second part containing alpha information as a grayscale) and combined at runtime. The option can be set on a per texture level, which affects the final atlas the texture lands in.</li>
<li>Application.UnloadLevel Unloading scenes is now possible while the game is running. References to lightmaps are cleared but you have to call Resources.UnloadUnusedAssets(); to actaully unload them. Enlighten data is unloaded immediately. This feature is especially useful in conjuntion with Lightmapping.BakeMultipleLevels(string[] scenes);</li>
<li>Audio: Ability to set custom rolloff curves for an AudioSource at runtime via script The following curves will be able to be set at runtime: Volume RolloffSpatial Blend (2D / 3D)Reverb Zone MixSpreadLowPass Filter Cutoff Frequency</li>
<li>Audio: Spatialization API (updated SDK and example on https://bitbucket.org/Unity-Technologies/nativeaudioplugins)</li>
<li>Cloud Service: Access control list support</li>
<li>CullingGroups: Added CullingGroup API, which allows you to specify a large set of bounding spheres that are integrated into the culling pipeline and subjected to frustum and occlusion culling.</li>
<li>Graphics: Added option in player settings for configurable vertex compression. Default values: position and UV1 is uncompressed, the rest of the channels are compressed.</li>
<li>Multi Scene Lighting baking. Lightmapping.BakeMultipleScenes(string[] scenes); Lets you bake lightmaps, reflection probes and realtime lightmaps for multiple scenes which together, which can be loaded additively. Data is automatically split on bake per scene.</li>
<li>Networking: Added NetworkDiscovery component to network HLAPI. This exposes the network transport layer local discovery function to HLAPI code, and allow Unity games on a local network to find each other.</li>
<li>New low-level native plugin API.</li>
<li>Out of the box support for VisualStudio Tools for Unity (aka UnityVS)</li>
<li>Physics: Added parameter QueryTriggerInteraction to all physics queries (raycast, spherecast, overlap) to allow any query to override whether or not the query should hit Triggers.</li>
<li>Physics: Expose CharacterController.skinWidth parameter to scripts</li>
<li>Physics: Expose impulse applied at contact (see Collision.impulse)</li>
<li>Physics: Support scaling vehicles</li>
<li>Shaders: Fixed Function shaders work on all platforms now (including consoles). They are always generated at shader import time (a button "show generated code" in shader inspector shows the code); removed all runtime support. All rendering got slightly faster (even when not using fixed function shaders); and executable sizes got slightly smaller.MaterialPropertyBlocks work with them now (which means Sprites and animated materials work too).Behave more consistently across platforms (specular highlights and light attenuation was slightly different before).Fixed function shaders aren't rasterized at a half-pixel shift on WP8 anymore.However, can not create fixed function shaders using "new Material(string)" at runtime anymore; see Changes section.</li>
<li>UI: 2D Rect Mask. A mask for 2D UI elements. Performs faster than the existing stencil buffer mask and does not require additional draw calls to prime the stencil buffer. When an element is outside the bounds of the mask the canvas renderer is also culled which leads to faster batching performance.</li>
<li>Unity Ads: Enable and configure Ads from the Unity Connect window in the Editor</li>
<li>WebGL: allow .jspre files to be added to the project to be prefixed to the generated JavaScript</li>
<li>WebGL: Experimental support for WebGL 2.0 (not yet supported in any released browser)</li>
<li>Windows 10 Universal apps now support x64.</li>
<li>Windows Store Apps: Universal Windows Platform app (Windows 10) support.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Change</h3>

<ul>
<li>Editor: Asset Store window is now a part of the default window layout. Docked behind the scene &amp; game views.</li>
<li>Editor: Remove legacy OSX corner window resize behaviour.</li>
<li>GI: Set default BounceScale to 1.</li>
<li>Graphics: Material.CopyPropertiesFromMaterial also copies shader keywords and render queue now.</li>
<li>IL2CPP: Make engine stripping in iOS/WebGL a separate setting (PlayerSettings.stripEngineCode) from mono stripping levels</li>
<li>Introduce EditorSettings.projectGenerationUserExtensions &amp; EditorSettings.projectGenerationBuiltinExtensions.</li>
<li>OpenGL: Modify -force-glcoreXX behaves like -force-glesXX trying to run this specification of OpenGL and taking advantage of all available extensions</li>

<li>Mecanim : Renaning Animator parameters updates transitions using those parameters.</li>
<li>Mecanim: 3DS MAX Auto Mapping and T-Pose. When setting an Avatar Animation Type to Humanoid, the Auto-Configure will try to detect if it is a Biped. If the hierarchy and naming of Biped is found, then default mapping and t-pose for biped will be used. Translation DoF will also be automatically activated for that avatar. The avatar can still be re-configured from this point, but usually default Biped mapping, t-pose and translation DoF will give the best results. Note that only Bipeds with no “Triangle Pelvis” and using default naming are supported.</li>
<li>Mecanim: Added a "destructive action" prompt when deleting blend tree nodes, so that the behaviour is consistent between StateMachine and BlendTree graphs.</li>
<li>Mecanim: Added AnimationClipPlayable.speed to the API</li>
<li>Mecanim: Added AnimatorStateInfo.speed and AnimatorStateInfo.speedMultiplier.</li>
<li>Mecanim: Added the name of the controller to Console errors that are generated for invalid parameters in blend trees.</li>
<li>Mecanim: Added the possibility to create AnyState Transitions to the entry node of a state machine. In a sub state machine, this is essentially the same as creating an AnyState Transition to a sub state machine from the parent state machine. This also adds a straightforward way to add an AnyState Transition to the top-level state machine, which was previously only possible through roundabout methods.</li>
<li>Mecanim: Added tooltips to blendtree slides.</li>
<li>Mecanim: Added tracking of missing or invalid StateMachineBehaviours in the StateMachine and State inspectors. Missing or Invalid StateMachineBehaviours shouldn't disappear anymore from the inspector.</li>
<li>Mecanim: Adding a child blend tree will use the default blend tree parameter, not the blend parameter of the parent.</li>
<li>Mecanim: Alt-drag works for BlendTree graph view</li>
<li>Mecanim: BlendTree Api now publishes useAutomaticThresholds</li>
<li>Mecanim: Can create new clip from selected clip/take in Animation importer</li>
<li>Mecanim: Clarify doc for Animator.bodyPosition and bodyRotation.</li>
<li>Mecanim: Creating a blend tree in a controller with no float parameter will now automatically add a new float parameter named Blend.</li>
<li>Mecanim: Expose Animator.IsInitialized in scripting API.</li>
<li>Mecanim: Fixing empty State Machine Behaviour after compilation error</li>
<li>Mecanim: Import humanoid animation now reports warnings in “Animations Inspector” instead of flooding the Console.</li>
<li>Mecanim: Import humanoid animation warnings have been cleaned and improved. A “Warning” summary box has been added at the top of Animation Inspector to prevent warnings to be left unnoticed. Warnings are reported per take when animation file contains multiple takes. Warnings have been added when in-between humanoid bones rotation differs in Source Avatar and Animation. Text has been reformatted so that is easier to consult the warning report.</li>
<li>Mecanim: Improved animator warning for API function Play/CrossFade. Warning should display which animator is throwing the error.</li>
<li>Mecanim: Improved default IK Hint for legs. Default IK Hint for knee now points towards foot direction. It gives a more natural IK solving for leg when IK correction needed gets bigger.</li>
<li>Mecanim: Improved display of transition previewer.</li>
<li>Mecanim: Mecanims Humanoid animation jitters - A.K.A. Humanoid Oversampling. For some animations, usually those with fast motion, the Humanoid interpolation may differ from original Euler rotation interpolation. In those rare cases, use animator.humanoidOversampling to increase sampling rate. ModelImporterHumanoidOversampling.X2 up to X8 can be used… Usually 2 will do the job! Default is X1 or no oversampling. Key reducing can be used conjointly to only keep Humanoid animation oversampled keys where it is needed while reducing asset size.</li>
<li>Mecanim: Retargeting quality for humanoid import animation. The retargeting quality compares original generic animation with humanoid retargeted animation. An average or maximum position error greater than 1.0 “normalized” mm will be reported. An average or maximum error greater than 0.5 degree will be reported. The time (and frame number) in full take of maximum errors is also reported. The position and rotation errors are reported per human body parts. The Retargeting Quality report can be turned on or off in Import Message foldout of Animation Inspector. It is off by default as it makes file import slower.</li>
<li>Mecanim: SetBoneLocalRotation. Animator.SetBoneLocalRotation(Quaternion r) let you modify the local rotation of humanoid bone during IK passes/OnAnimatorIK() callback. It can be used to modify the pose of a humanoid avatar after Animation Blending, but that will still be taken in account by IK Solving. Ex: Adjust Hips and Spine rotation to drive lower and upper body independently on top of animation.</li>
<li>Mecanim: Show frame number in avatar previewer.</li>
<li>Mecanim: Support Layers Affect Mass Center for AnimatorControllerPlayable.</li>
<li>Mecanim: Translation DoF for Humanoid. Some animation files come with translation animation on humanoid bones. For example, it is the case with 3DS MAX Biped that comes with translation on 1st Spine bone. Translation DoF can be activated on those humanoid avatar to convert translation animation to retargetable translation DoFs. Translation DoF affects Spine, Shoulders, Upper Legs and Neck bones. Translation DoFs usually represent small amount of translation that improves retargeting quality. Translation DoF may also be used to improve retargeting quality when animation has more than two animated spine bones. Translation DoF can be activated in Muscle &amp; Setting tab of Humanoid configure window.</li>
<li>Mecanim: Updated documentation for AnimatorOverrideController.</li>
<li>Merge Tool: Fix merging of scenes/prefabs with out of order objects</li>
<li>Metro: AppCallbacks.LoadGfxNativePlugin has been deprecated. All plugins that are in the project and set to build for a given platform are now loaded automatically. The function still exists and does nothing, but it will be removed in a future Unity version.</li>
<li>Networking: Added OnLobbyServerPlayersReady callback to the NetworkLobbyManager to allow users to perform custom behaviour when all the players in the lobby are ready.</li>
<li>Networking: Added support for client-side authority for non-player objects. The new function NetworkServer.SpawnWithClientAuthority(GameObject obj, NetworkConnection conn) allows authority to be assigned to a client by its connection when an object is created. This would typically be used in a command handler for a client asking to spawn an object, then the client's connection would be passed in. For example: [Command] void CmdSpawn() { var go = (GameObject)Instantiate(otherPrefab, transform.position + new Vector3(0,1,0), Quaternion.identity); NetworkServer.SpawnWithClientAuthority(go, base.connectionToClient); } For setting the authority on objects after they are created, there are the new functions AssignClientAuthority(NetworkConnection conn) andRemoveClientAuthority(NetworkConnection conn) on the NetworkIdentity class. Note that only one client can be the authority for an object at a time. On the client that has authority, the function OnStartAuthority() is called, and the property hasAuthority will be true. The set of objects that is owned by a client is available in the new property NetworkConnection.clientOwnedObjects which is a set of NetworkInstanceIds. This set can be used on the server when a message is received to ensure that the client that sent the message actually owns the object. When a client disconnects, the function DestroyPlayersForConnection now destroys all the objects owned by that connection, not just the player object. Objects which have their authority set to a client must have LocalPlayerAuthority set in their NetworkIdentity. Previously only player objects could have local authority, which meant that the NetworkTransform (and other components) could only be used for controlling the single player object for a connection on a client. With these changes it is possible to have multiple objects on a client that are locally controlled.</li>
<li>Networking: Added support for network [Command] calls from non-player objects with authority on a client. Since in 5.2 clients can have authority over non-player objects using NetworkServer.SpawnWithClientAuthority() or NetworkIdentity.AssignClientAuthority(), network Commands were extended from being allowed from just the player object to any object that is controlled by a client.</li>
<li>Networking: Added the ability for the NetworkTransform to validate on the server, the movement of authoritative client objects. There are now clientMoveCallback delegates on the NetworkTransform that allow user code to process 2D and 3D movement updates from clients before they are applied. This callback code can reject movement requests completely or modify the movement data. When used in conjuction with client-side movement checks this provides a more secure movement model for multiplayer games.</li>
<li>OpenGL: Added -force-clamped prevents trying to use all available extensions when used together with -force-glcoreXX or -force-glesXX</li>
<li>OpenGL: Added -force-gles editor and standalone player to automatically run with the best version of ES supported by the platform</li>
<li>OpenGL: Fallback gracefully to Direct3D when requesting OpenGL/ES with -force-gl** when the platform doesn't have a good enough OpenGL support.</li>
<li>OpenGL: Fallback gracefully to OpenGL when requesting OpenGL ES but it's not supported (all AMD GPUs, older than Intel IvyBridge IGP)</li>
<li>OSX: sometimes MonoDevelop &amp; XamarinStudio would open both.</li>
<li>Particles: Mesh particles now support the Texture Sheet Animation settings</li>
<li>Physics: Now you can set negative WheelCollider.forceAppPointDistance. This allows to adjust forceAppPointDistance in order to have suspension and tire forces applied at the wheel base</li>
<li>Physics: Renamed 'CollisionDetectionMode2D.None' to 'CollisionDetectionMode2D.Discrete' (Will be auto-updated).</li>
<li>Playables: Improved connection API: GetInput(index), GetInputCount, ClearInputs, and more.</li>
<li>Playables: No longer necessary to create a PlayableController to play a tree of Playables. The Animator (and other DirectorPlayer) now expose new Play(Playable root) API.</li>
<li>Reflection Probes: Make deferred probe blend distance configurable</li>
<li>Reflection Probes: when using Deferred Shading, the reflection probes are now rendered per-pixel (instead of each object only being affected by one or two probes). This will allow doing SSRR (screen space raytraced reflections) properly soon. More details in this document.</li>
<li>Scripting: Added Cubemap.mipmapCount</li>
<li>Shader: Added finalgbuffer and finalprepass modifiers. They work in the same way as finalcolor does, but are used by the deferred and prepass base paths respectively for altering what would be written into the gbuffer.</li>
<li>Shader: decal:add surface shaders now generate code for deferred and legacy deferred paths if finalgbuffer and finalprepass modifiers are specified.</li>
<li>Shader: Now skip_variants directive skips user variants as well.</li>
<li>Shaders: "Procedural Skybox" shader now has selectable options for Sun Disk: None (fastest), Simple (should be close to the current sun disk), High Quality.</li>
<li>Shaders: Make it possible to use UNITY_SAMPLE_SHADOW when SHADOWS_NATIVE is not explicitly defined.</li>
<li>SpeedTree: Negated tangent vectors to match those in the SpeedTree Modeler.</li>
<li>SpeedTree: Now shader has less variants due to the merge of some geometry types.</li>
<li>Stacktrace logging: Allow to log full (native/managed) stack trace when log is printed, the option is available in the console window in top right corner popup menu. Also check Application.stackTraceLogType API. Works in Editor and Windows/OSX standalone players.</li>
<li>Substance: "visibleIf" expressions set in Substance Designer are now properly evaluated (for inputs only) and inputs are now displayed or hidden accordingly.</li>
<li>Substance: Dynamic parameter in Substance graphs are now evaluated using native code instead of bytecode on Windows / OSX / Linux, resulting in faster texture generation.</li>
<li>Substance: Feature parity with Substance Designer 5.1.</li>
<li>Substance: Runtime generation of ProceduralMaterials is now supported on PS4 and XboxOne.</li>
<li>Substance: Updated the Substance Engine libraries to Substance Designer 5.1.1 feature parity.</li>

<li>Terrain: Now a TerrainData object embedded into a scene (created by script) allows scene objects being selected as tree prefabs.</li>
<li>Terrain: Now terrain renders in deferred and legacy deferred path.</li>
<li>Terrain: Renamed "Wind Settings" label to "Wind Settings for Grass".</li>
<li>Terrain: Trees painted on the terrain now are scaled by the prototype's transform scaling.</li>
<li>TrueTypeFontImporter: References to other font assets to be used in the project as fallback are now shown in the TrueTypeFontImporter inspector</li>
<li>UI: Add callback to MaskableGraphic for when it becomes culled via the 2d culling API</li>
<li>UI: Added support for EventType.ExecuteCommand "SelectAll" to InputField so that it works in the Editor</li>

<li>UI: Make the default value for a slider / scrollbar be 0</li>
<li>UI: Multithreaded UI system backend. The UI system batching code is now multithreaded this leads to a performance increase of up 4x (in our stress test scenes).</li>
<li>UI: Remove (Pro Only) from UI shaders as they can be used on any version of Unity since 5.0</li>
<li>Unity Connect: State machine for project Info</li>

<li>WebGL: Resolution set in html file will no longer be overridden by PlayerSettings</li>
<li>Windows Store Apps/Windows Phone 8.1/Windows Universal Apps: Unity will generate projects in a consistent way with Visual Studio. For ex., When specifying project names with whitespaces or symbols like '-', '.', Unity will no longer strip those symbols when creating folders, note this might break existing projects if you're building on top of old directory and your project name contains one of these symbols. (Backwards comptability breakage)</li>
<li>Windows Store Apps/Windows Phone 8.1/Windows Universal Apps: Unity will properly use project name instead of hardcoded "Template" word, when creating App.xaml, App.xaml.cs, MainPage.xaml, MainPage.xaml.cs, AssemblyInfo.cs files. (Backwards comptability breakage)</li>
